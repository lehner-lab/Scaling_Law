# About this repository

Hi, welcome to the GitHub repository for the manuscript titled **_Combinatorially-complete mutagenesis reveals a global scaling law for the effects of mutations on alternative splicing_** which has been sent out for peer review. Here you'll find all the scripts needed to reproduce the results from the computational analyses described in the paper.

Most scripts are accompanied by a markdown file (.md extension) that describes the code in a bit more detail, although the scripts are generally well commented.
